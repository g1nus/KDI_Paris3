|Clark Nuckerberg|51|art, history|find: free wi-fi hotspots, interesting points of interest|Clark is an American CEO going on a business trip in Germany. He must stop in Paris to switch planes and has 6 hours to spare. He has never visited Paris so he’s very excited to spend a few hours there and see the most famous places. Since his travel expenses are completely covered by his company, he wants to take a taxi to travel the city in the most comfortable and secure way. Indeed, he carries his personal laptop and important business files with him, so the pickpockets in crowded streets must be avoided at all costs. Clark’s passion is art and history, so he would like to find a museum which is open during his 6-hour stop and doesn’t take more than 1 hour to visit. He also has to make an important Zoom call, so he would like to stop in a coffee shop where there is free wifi and a quiet environment.|
|Lilian Bidou|25|bikes, nature|find: cycling tracks, parks, free-entry events|Lilian is a french tourist who is spending one week in Paris with his girlfriend. She doesn't know it, but he plans on proposing during this holiday. Lilian needs help to find romantic locations to create the best possible experience for his soon-to-be fiancée. He spend all his money on the ring, so he is on a tight budget and will go to parks or free-entry events rather than museums. He also would love to try tandem with his girlfriend, but he needs to find a safe bicycle track with a low speed limit because she doesn't know how to ride a bike!|
|Isabella Massini|47|family, religion, environment|find: events for children, parking spots|Isabella is an Italian nurse, who moved to a small city one hour away from Paris, two years ago. She loves religious history and spending her free time with her husband and their two children (6 and 9 years old). She occasionally visits Paris with them during the weekend, mostly to visit museums or participate in Christian community events. Isabella is very environmentally conscious, and tries as much as possible to use bikes instead of busses when she travels alone inside Paris. She wants to buy an electrical bike but is not sure if it is worth the money, so when she is in the city she rents electric bikes if they are available, to try them out. During her family cultural trips, she has to take the car because of her children. But she is not really familiar with the car parking areas in the city since she always use bikes. Isabella moved in a small village near Paris because she doesn't like the noise and crowed streets of the capital. This is why, when she visits museums, she wants to buy tickets as close as possible of opening hour or closing hour.|
|Ginno Zebest|27|programming, parties|find: parking spots, basic necessities, good living place|Gino is a full-stack programmer in freelance. His business is working really well and he plans on buying a flat in Paris to have an permanent office and greet clients. Since this is a heavy investment, he needs to make sure that the location of the flat meets his criteria. Ginno doesn't have a car, but if there are parking area around it will be easier for clients to reach him. Also, he loves to party so he definitely needs to know if there are bars and nightclubs in his neighborhood. He also wants to make sure that the basic necessities (pharmacy, grocery store, bakery, ...) are in a 15 minute walking range.|
|Brigitte Norcam|83|cross-stitch, cooking|find: close parks, points of intersets, events|Brigitte is a loving grand-mother having her grand-children over one week-end per month. Even though Brigitte wants to do a lot of activities with her grand-children, she is quickly tired and needs to limit as much as possible the traveling time. So she will always select the closest alternative to her flat, in order to be able to go home to rest if needed.|
|Martina Rossi|38|books, teaching|find: quiet parks and museums, PMR-access activities|Martina is an elementary school teacher. For a school trip, Marina and her pupils are spending one day in Paris. She needs to plan the day to make sure everything goes smoothly. One of her pupil is in a wheelchair, so she needs to make sure that the proposed activities have a PMR access. This is also a constraint to take into account when taking public transports or going into a restaurant for lunch. She will usually aim for quiet places like parks or museums because the noise and the crowd can be overwhelming for some of her pupils.|
|Marie Dubois|19|music, culture|find: shopping activies, public transport stations|Marie is an Erasmus student in Beauvais. She is from a small town in Roumania and enjoys going to Paris with her friends during the week-end. She loves music festivals and tries to participate in as many cultural events as possible to make the most of her stay in France. Marie's other passion is shopping, but since she is a student, she needs to be very smart with the way she spends money. For this reason she usually prefers walking instead of taking public transports, and always looks for student discounts at events. When Marie and her friend decide to go shopping, they plan their itinerary in advance to save time and energy.|
|Tommaso Sopa|31|travelling, cooking|find: events, traditional restaurants|He’s a travel-blogger with a passion for food and original recipes. He travels the world looking for inspiration for his book on culinary arts. Tommaso is a real foodie and when he goes in a restaurant, he wants to taste authentic local cuisine. Usually, when he travels, he selects areas famous for their traditional dishes and spends around a month there. During his stay, he will try every single restaurant in the area and write comments about them on the Internet. He also goes to food festivals to meet people with the same passion as him and maybe get invited to share a homemade meal. Next month he will be in Paris, and will of course explore the restaurants of every district.|
